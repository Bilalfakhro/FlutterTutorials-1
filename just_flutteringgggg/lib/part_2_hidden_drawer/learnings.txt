Flutter doesn't render the text that is off the screen

    Simply wrap it under OverflowBox() and you are good to go


Want to make your Widget produce ripple/TapEffect when tappeed?
    
    Wrap it under InkwellEffect()

    NOTE: The widget(InkwellEffect) should be direct child of Material widget
